        <p> <blockquote><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had known my life would one day be a story to share, I would have started writing a diary long ago.<sup><b>1</b></sup> A boy named <strong>Jerome</strong> was born into a not-so-privileged family.<sup><b>2</b></sup> He was the first-born child of two hardworking parents—his father, a tricycle driver, and his mother, a server at a fast-food restaurant.<sup><b>3</b></sup> In his infant and toddler years, he lived with his parents in a small apartment in Rizal.<sup><b>4</b></sup> However, when he turned four, his mother had to work overseas to support their family.<sup><b>5</b></sup> From that moment on, his aunt and grandparents took care of him.<sup><b>6</b></sup> Jerome spent the rest of his formative years with his grandparents and enjoyed helping out at their food stall.<sup><b>7</b></sup> His grandfather would often take him to their province in Quezon without his parents’ permission, but Jerome <em>loved</em> every moment of it.<sup><b>8</b></sup>He <em>cherished</em> the feeling of sand between his toes, the simple life in the barrio, and, most of all, the beautiful beach where he learned to swim.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Jerome’s preschool years were <strong>filled with achievements</strong>—he ranked Top 1 in nursery, excelled in most subjects, and was again Top 1 in kindergarten.<sup><b>10</b></sup> Because of his strong performance, he was <strong>accelerated to Grade 1</strong> in a private school.<sup><b>11</b></sup> However, he was later transferred to a public school, where he experienced a <em>cultural shift</em> that took time to adjust to.<sup><b>12</b></sup> From Grades 1 to 4, he didn’t make many friends and barely remembers his experiences with them.<sup><b>13</b></sup> After four years of working abroad, Jerome’s mother returned to the Philippines when he was around seven years old.<sup><b>14</b></sup> A year later, at the age of eight, he became an older brother, filling his heart with <em>love</em> and <em>happiness</em>.<sup><b>15</b></sup>Three years later, he welcomed another sibling, a baby sister.<sup><b>16</b></sup> In Grade 5, Jerome stepped out of his comfort zone and participated in a <strong>Sabayang Pagbigkas competition</strong>.<sup><b>17</b></sup> Although his team <strong>placed 6th</strong>, he enjoyed the experience.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Determined, he tried again in Grade 6, but this time he joined a <abbr title = "Bigkas, Sayaw, at Awit"><strong>BigSayWit</strong></abbr> competition.<sup><b>19</b></sup> His team won <strong>Champion</strong> in Rodriguez and placed <strong>4th</strong> in Rizal, marking one of the highlights of his elementary school years. <sup><b>20</b></sup> </blockquote></blockquote></p>

        <h2> <blockquote><blockquote>Finding Confidence</blockquote></blockquote></h2>
        <p><blockquote><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Jerome entered his teenage years, his parents opened a business that slowly changed their lives for the better.<sup><b>1</b></sup> He also gained another sibling—a younger brother, who is now the youngest in the family.<sup><b>2</b></sup> Jerome attended his dream school in his hometown, a Catholic institution with beautiful gardens, impressive buildings, and a stunning mountain view.<sup><b>3</b></sup> The school was wonderful, but Jerome faced challenges.<sup><b>4</b></sup> The students there were exceptionally talented, and Jerome <em>struggled</em> to keep up.<sup><b>5</b></sup> In Grade 7, his grades were barely satisfactory, but over time, he continued to improve.<sup><b>6</b></sup> Despite his progress, his experiences at the school led to a decline in his self-esteem, which caused a fear of stepping outside his comfort zone.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Jerome graduated from Grade 10 <strong>with honors</strong> but decided to transfer schools.<sup><b>8</b></sup> He asked his parents if he could study at the <strong>University of the East in Manila</strong> as an <abbr title = "Information Communication Technology"><strong>ICT</abbr> track</strong> student.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Thankfully, his parents agreed.<sup><b>10</b></sup> At his new school, Jerome flourished.<sup><b>11</b></sup> With new classmates and a fresh environment, he was able to do all the things he had wanted to at his former school.<sup><b>12</b></sup> He became a student leader, joined various organizations, aimed for excellence, and was even elected as a <strong>student council officer</strong>.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Jerome graduated Senior High School <strong>with high honors</strong> through hard work.<sup><b>14</b></sup> He was deeply <em>grateful</em> for the support he received from his family and friends throughout his academic journey.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Along the way, Jerome also learned a great deal about his family’s business.<sup><b>16</b></sup> By the age of 14, he was capable of running the entire business.<sup><b>17</b></sup> He often accompanied his mother to business meetings, and over the years, Jerome became a business-minded individual whom his parents could always trust.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Due to his experiences, Jerome became a role model for his younger siblings, and he promised to continue doing his best to make his parents proud.<sup><b>19</b></sup> With his past shaping him, Jerome entered college ready to embrace new challenges and opportunities on his journey forward.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

        <h2> <blockquote><blockquote>Pursuing Dreams</blockquote></blockquote></h2>
        <p><blockquote><blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerome, considering his future, saw his dream of becoming a <strong>game developer</strong> fade due to the uncertain prospects of the profession in this country.<sup><b>1</b></sup> He opted for the <abbr title = "Bachelor of Science in Information Technology"> <strong>BSIT</strong></abbr> program at the <strong>University of the East</strong>.<sup><b>2</b></sup> In his first semester, Jerome found the material easy to grasp, as it felt like a repetition of what he had learned in Senior High School.<sup><b>3</b></sup> He <em>enjoyed</em> his college experience, with a more flexible schedule that allowed him to explore new places and make new friends.<sup><b>4</b></sup> His hard work paid off when he earned a college scholarship.<sup><b>5</b></sup> During his second semester, Jerome met someone special, and they supported each other in their studies while enjoying cute dates together.<sup><b>6</b></sup> However, Jerome caught chickenpox halfway through the semester, which caused him to fall behind.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Despite the setback, he remained determined to keep his grades up.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Though didn’t have many activities or events during the summer break, he focused on his passion for game development.<sup><b>9</b></sup> He spent the time building a Roblox game using Lua programming for scripting and Roblox Studio for design.<sup><b>10</b></sup> When Jerome entered his second year, his schedule became more intense, with classes from Monday to Thursday.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Living in Rodriguez, Rizal meant long commutes, which made it hard for him to perform at his best due to fatigue.<sup><b>12</b></sup> Nonetheless, he managed to finish the first semester with good grades and formed new friendships that made him feel loved and accepted.<sup><b>13</b></sup> During the Christmas break, Jerome thoughtfully prepared gifts for the person he loves and spent the holidays joyfully with his family.<sup><b>14</b></sup> As the new year began, he moved into a dormitory to make his school life easier and focus more on his studies.<sup><b>15</b></sup> However, the second semester proved to be quite challenging.<sup><b>16</b></sup> The heavy workloads and demanding major courses were <em>overwhelming</em>.<sup><b>17</b></sup> Jerome was also preparing for the research topic he would need for his third year and capstone project.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Despite the challenges, Jerome stayed focused on his goals, <em>determined</em> to keep moving forward, one step at a timeless.<sup><b>19</b></sup> So far, this has been the life highlights of Jerome — from the day he was born to now, as he navigates college life.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
